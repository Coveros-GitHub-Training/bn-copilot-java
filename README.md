# GitHub Copilot Workshop - FlavorHub

Welcome to the **GitHub Copilot Workshop**! This comprehensive workshop teaches you how to use GitHub Copilot as an AI-powered assistant throughout the software development lifecycle. Through practical exercises using a real-world recipe application, you'll learn to leverage Copilot for code generation, understanding, refactoring, and autonomous development.

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

This hands-on lab is designed to give developers practical experience using **GitHub Copilot** across all phases of the SDLC. Built around **FlavorHub**—a professional Spring Boot application for managing recipes and pantry ingredients—you'll explore how GitHub Copilot can improve developer productivity, code quality, and collaboration.

### What You'll Learn

Through guided, real-world exercises, you will:
- Understand GitHub Copilot's role across all phases of the SDLC
- Use AI-powered code completions directly within the IDE
- Leverage GitHub Copilot Chat in Ask, Edit, and Agent modes
- Explore GitHub Copilot Spaces for collaborative development
- Delegate tasks to the GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent
- Optimize GitHub Copilot with Custom Instructions and Prompt Files
- Apply engineering best practices for AI-assisted development

## 🚀 Quick Start

The first thing to do is to make sure that you create your own copy of this repository so that you can keep all of the work you do in this training.

This repository is set up as a template, so you can easily create your own copy from it!

1. From the `Code` tab of the repository click the green `Use this template` button in the top right.
2. Select `Create a new repository`
3. Here you select how you want to create the repository.
   - Owner: select either yourself or an organization you have access to
   - Visibility: select whatever option you prefer. (Note: for users in an EMU you will not be able to select public as an option)
   - Do not input anything for the Copilot prompt

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started:

1. Click the **"Code"** button on the repository page
2. Select the **"Codespaces"** tab
3. Click **"Create codespace on main"**
4. Wait for the environment to build (this may take a few minutes)

The codespace will automatically:
- Install Java 21 and Maven
- Install all dependencies
- Configure GitHub Copilot and VS Code extensions
- Build the FlavorHub application
- Provide a ready-to-use development environment

Once ready, navigate to the flavorhub directory and start the application:
```bash
cd flavorhub
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Open the forwarded port (default: 8080) to view the application.

### Option 2: Local Development

**Prerequisites:**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or newer
- Maven 3.6+ (or use included Maven Wrapper)
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)

**Setup:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<YOURORGANIZATION>/<YOURREPOSITORYNAME>.git
cd <YOURREPOSITORYNAME>/flavorhub

# Build and run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the application.

## 📖 Getting Started

1. **Review the Glossary**: Start with the [Glossary](docs/Glossary.md) to familiarize yourself with Copilot terminology
2. **Start with Lab 1**: Begin with [Lab 1 - Getting Started](labs/Lab-1-Getting-Started.md)
3. **Follow the sequence**: Complete labs in order for the best learning experience
4. **Practice hands-on**: Each lab includes practical exercises and examples
5. **Reference as needed**: Use the [Glossary](docs/Glossary.md) to look up unfamiliar terms during the labs
6. **Explore freely**: Feel free to experiment beyond the guided exercises
